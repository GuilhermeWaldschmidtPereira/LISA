# Introduction

LISA is a learned index structure for spatial data, similar in functionality to a R-Tree.
More details about LISA can be found in our [SIGMOD 2020 paper](https://doi.org/10.1145/3318464.3389703).

# Getting Started
We implement LISA with python 2.7. You need to install two scientific computing package: numpy and scipy.
The codes can be found [here](https://github.com/pfl-cs/LISA).

### Data
The input data for building LISA is a numpy ndarray file whose path is "your workspace/data/file_name".

### More
Detailed documentation will be available soon.
